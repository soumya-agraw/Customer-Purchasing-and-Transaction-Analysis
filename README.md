# Customer-Purchasing-and-Transaction-Analysis
This project aims to analyze customer data and transactions from various retail stores. By understanding who the chip buyers are and how they shop, we can gain valuable insights to inform our supermarket's future chip category strategy.

The analysis will focus on key business metrics like total sales and store performance, helping us identify the most relevant customer segments to target.  We'll use this data to build a data-driven strategic recommendation, presented via Tableau, that will be instrumental in shaping our upcoming category review.
